# HTML-and-CSS-Projects-
This repository will containt code I have written for Tech Academy assignments. Some files will contain original code written by me while other files will contain copied code from The Tech Academy for learning purposes.

I have created about 15 test projects that iclude basic HTML, basic CSS, and basic JavaScript. Some of my bigger projects are the one-page-website and Project_Basic_HTML. This lessons were put to use on my other repository, Student_Portfolio.
