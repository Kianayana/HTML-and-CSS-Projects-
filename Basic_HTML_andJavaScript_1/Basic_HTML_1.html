	<p><font size="6">Hide all your precious belongings in a <u>safe</u> if you want to keep them.</font></p>
	
	<p><strong><font color="orange" size="4">If you do not have a safe, you can purchase a <u>lock box</u> and place several heavy items on top of it and around it.</font></strong></p>
	
	<p><font color=#4B0082 face="Georgia" size="2">If you are unable to purchase a <u>lock box</u>, your only option of keeping any value from your prized possession is to <b>sell it</b> before the pixie arrives.</font></p>
