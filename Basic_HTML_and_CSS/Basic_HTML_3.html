		<h2><u><b>#5.</b> <i>Misadventures</i></u></h2>
		<p>Their fourth album did not hook me like the others. I can easily listen to all the other albums all the way through, but I'm always tempted to skip songs when listening to this album.</p>

		<h2><u><b>#4.</b> <i>A Flair For The Dramatic</i></u></h2>
		<p>Their first studio album is a rough, but captivating piece of work. It is easy to ignore the roughness as you follow the changing rhythyms through each song. This is an amazing album and is only this low on the list because PTV grew into even better musicians.</p>

		<h2><u><b>#3.</b> <i>The Jaws of Life</i></u></h2>
		<p>Their fifth album is an <em>unskippable</em> album that is full of pain that was felt as the entire world crumbled and changed around us over the past 3 years. This may also seem low on the list, but many of my favorite PTV songs are tied to nostalgia. This album is less than 2 months old and may be at a different spot 1, 5, 10 years from now.</p>

		<p>This is the album that put PTV on the map. "Caraphernelia" and "Bulletproof Love" continue to be some of their most popular songs. Their sophmore album is where they refined their sound and began to lay into their unique sound. It is the album that changed PTV from "some other band" to "my favorite band." </p>
